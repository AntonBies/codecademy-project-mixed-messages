# Codecademy Project Mixed Messages
This app produces a prediction for one NBA game each time it's run. It will pick a random home team and away team and generate a score between 70 and 130 for each team.\
To simulate a home-court advantage, the home team will get a 5 point bonus in addition to its generated score (over a large number of simulations this would lead to a home-court win rate of about 58%).\
The program logs the prediction to the console.

## Example output
```
NBA Prediction:
Golden State Warriors @ Cleveland Caveliers
Final score: 83 - 104
```
